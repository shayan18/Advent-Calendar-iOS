Compositional layouts are a declarative kind of API that allows us to build large layouts by stitching together smaller layout groups. Compositional layouts have a hierarchy that consists of: Item, Group, Section, and Layout.
Diffable Data Source help our application to handle change in data source in future if there is live gift data from API. We can update our views easily.
